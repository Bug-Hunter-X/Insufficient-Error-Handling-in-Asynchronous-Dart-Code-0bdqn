# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository showcases a common error in Dart code involving insufficient error handling within asynchronous operations. The example demonstrates how a simple `try-catch` block is not enough for production-ready code and how to improve it.

## Problem

The `bug.dart` file contains a function that fetches data from an API. While it includes a `try-catch` block, it only prints error messages.  This is insufficient; a better solution would provide users with more informative error feedback and potentially implement retry mechanisms or fallback strategies.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file offers an improved version that handles errors more gracefully.  It provides more specific error messages and demonstrates a simple retry mechanism.
